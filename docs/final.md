##Project Summary
	The goal of this project is to have an agent learn to run through a "parkour" map. In other words, the agent should be able to traverse a designated path that may contain obstacles such as raised platforms or stairs to reach a desired destination. More specifically, the agent would start on a stone block and learn to go through a diamond path while avoiding obstacles in order to reach checkpoints represented by gold blocks and the end goal represented by an emerald block.
	The desired outcome would be for the agent to use continuous movement commands in order to traverse the path with the same range of movement as a human player, as opposed to the limited range of discrete movement commands. Using reinforcement learning, the agent should be able to develop a sense for the path that would allow it to traverse the path safely and as quickly as possible while gaining the highest reward overall. This project is also separate from projects relating to pathfinding algorithms as it is intended to learn a specified path/course as opposed to finding its own calculated path.
